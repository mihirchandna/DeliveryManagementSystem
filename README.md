# Delivery Management System
This project implements an efficient delivery management system to streamline the process of receiving and distributing packages to students residing in college hostels.

## Overview
The existing manual system for handling student package deliveries from the college main gate to individual hostels is inconvenient and chaotic. Students face long queues and uncertainty around package collection.

To address these pain points, this project develops:

A MySQL database to store delivery information
An intuitive web interface for students and administrators to manage deliveries
Robust PHP backend logic for smooth order processing
Key features:

Student package tracking
Secure administrator access
Delivery status updates
Package collection verification
Delivery analytics and reports

## Installation
The project requires:
* PHP 7.3+
* MySQL 5.7+
* Apache 2.4+

5. Create a database with name dms
6. Import dms.sql file(given inside the zip package in SQL file folder)
